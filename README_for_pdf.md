# Miranda Wilson

I'm a junior backend developer and [Makers](https://makers.tech) graduate who loves technical challenges and being organised. My background is in academic cell biology, so I'm used to independent learning and working, creative thinking, and being part of a team. I'm strongly motivated by the satisfaction of a job well done, especially if it involves making something.

## Projects

| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [**Spring Onion**](https://github.com/mscwilson/SmellsLikeGreenSpirit) (group project) | Mobile app that calculates carbon emissions for a car journey. I motivated my teammates to persevere, e.g. with asynchronous storage. | React Native, Jest |
| [**Acebook**](https://github.com/mscwilson/acebook-poke) (group project)  | Facebook-inspired social platform. I learned how gems such as Devise or acts-as-favoritor, and an Agile workflow, can speed up development. | Rails, Rspec              |
| [**Bowling Scorecard**](https://github.com/mscwilson/bowling) | 10-pin bowling score calculator. This project pushed me to improve my CSS knowledge. | JavaScript, jQuery, Jasmine             |


## Skills
* **Attention to Detail** I assimilate information very quickly and excel at noticing details and mistakes. This made me a successful cell biologist and allowed me to learn coding fast. I was also the de facto copy editor for all my colleagues at my last job.  
  
* **Project Management** My organisational skills have been well tested throughout my academic career. I performed over 900 experiments during my postdoc, across multiple simultaneous projects, while also teaching students. I have 20 published papers.  
  
* **Communication** As a scientist I regularly presented my work within the department, as well as at poster sessions at conferences. During Makers, daily remote pair programming allowed me to level up my ability to explain my thoughts and help others grasp new concepts. I've been told I'm a great teacher and leader.
