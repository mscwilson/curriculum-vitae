My CV




## Miranda Wilson

I'm a junior full stack Ruby developer looking to focus on back-end. I've --made/achieved stuff-- . I've chosen to move into this career because I love learning and making things, especially when it relates to technical problem-solving.

## Projects

## Skills
#### Attention to Detail
Noticing small details has always been a skill of mine. My ability to notice stray semi-colons and repeated words soon led my laboratory boss to add "copy-editor" to my postdoc job description. The same keenness also helped me keep track of results and reagents, and to learn coding easily.

#### Project Management
My project management skills developed first during my PhD and were strengthened during my postdoc. By the end of my postdoc, I was managing multiple strands of my own work, as well as helping two colleagues, teaching a student, and contributing to several international collaborations. Thanks to all of these efforts I was named on six publications 2019-2020. 

#### Creativity
Creativity is a big part of my life. As a scientist, I needed to be creative to solve problems and to explain my results. Outside of work, I'm happiest when I have a project on the go, whether it's making a shelf or a t-shirt.

#### Knowledge Acquisition
I love to learn new things, the more in-depth and technical the better. I pick up new ideas and concepts very easily. This is partly why I was confident in changing career!
