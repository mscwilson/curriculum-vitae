I'm a junior developer and [Makers](https://makers.tech) graduate who loves technical problem-solving. My background is in cell biology, where I made discoveries and developed tools to help others access my research field. I want to move into tech to continue empowering people through innovative technology, while learning new skills.


## Projects

| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [**Miranda Making Things**](https://github.com/mscwilson/mscwilson.github.io) | I designed and created a responsive site for my blog and portfolio. My blog gives me a space to share my excitement at the new things I'm learning. | Jekyll, Bootstrap |
| [**Spring Onion**](https://github.com/mscwilson/SmellsLikeGreenSpirit) (group project) | Environmentally-focused mobile app that calculates carbon emissions for a car journey. I motivated my teammates to persevere when we were blocked, e.g. with asynchronous API calls. | React Native, Jest |
| [**Acebook**](https://github.com/mscwilson/acebook-poke) (group project)  | Facebook-inspired social platform. I succeeded in setting up Continuous Deployment for the project, and experienced how an Agile workflow can speed up development. | Rails, Rspec              |
| [**Bowling Scorecard**](https://github.com/mscwilson/bowling) | 10-pin bowling score calculator. I focused on providing a great user experience through CSS. | JavaScript, jQuery, Jasmine             |
| [**Notes**](https://github.com/mscwilson/notes) (group project) | A vanilla JavaScript Single Page notes App. I guided the note storage solution. | JavaScript             |
| [**Rock Paper Scissors**](https://github.com/mscwilson/rps-challenge) | My first experience with the MVP pattern. I drew pictures to improve the game.  | Sinatra, Ruby, Rspec             |
| [**Advent of Code 2020**](https://github.com/mscwilson/AdventOfCode2020) | My solutions for the first 13 [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) algorithmic puzzles. I was proud that I managed to complete half of the 2020 problems, especially those needing recursive solutions. | Ruby              |

## Skills
* **Attention to Detail** I assimilate information very quickly and excel at noticing details and mistakes. This made me a successful cell biologist and allowed me to learn coding fast. I was also the de facto copy editor for all my colleagues at my last job.  
  
* **Project Management** My organisational skills have been well tested throughout my academic career. I performed over 900 experiments during my postdoc, across multiple simultaneous projects, while also teaching students. I have 20 published papers.  
  
* **Communication** During Makers, daily remote pair programming allowed me to level up my ability to explain my thoughts and help others grasp new concepts. As a scientist I regularly presented my work within the department, as well as at poster sessions at conferences. I've been told I'm a great teacher and leader.  
  
* **Determination** I don't give up easily. I'm happy to keep working on bugs and difficult tasks. My postdoc role was extremely technically challenging and took several years to start providing results.  
  
* **Creativity** In the laboratory, I needed to be creative to design experiments and to make sense of my findings. When programming, creativity allows me to write (according to a reviewer) "[clean and elegant](2021-03-22-Yellow%20Farfetchd%2026-feedback.pdf)" code. In my own time, I love to draw and make things, whether out of fabric, wood, or code.
